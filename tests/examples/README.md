## `examples/` directory
All directories in `examples/` are expected to have an `export` file
which is a valid export of a Lean code.

Export examples in `examples/` are automatically tested by `test_interpreter.py`.

## `invalid_examples/` directory
All directories in `invalid_examples` are expected to have an `export` file
which is an invalid export of Lean code.

These are generated by editing exports of valid Lean code.
The original Lean files and unaltered valid export code are included for documentation.

`test_interpreter.py` checks that these examples raise an exception.

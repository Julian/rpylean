# Lean Export Files

The examples in this directory are exports of Lean environments as produced by `lean4export`.

Some of these examples we constructed, some we adopted from other type checkers' suites.

Two subdirectories are present, `valid` and `invalid`, containing examples with the corresponding expectation.

The `invalid` examples are generated by editing exports of valid Lean code.
The original Lean files and unaltered valid export code are included for documentation.

Every example (in both subdirectories) is expected to have a file named `export` which is the actual exported contents.

`test_examples.py` checks that all examples have the expected outcome.
